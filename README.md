# Automated Financial Performance Dashboard (Excel)

**What:** One-click automated financial dashboard built in Excel. Ingests sample CSVs (`sales.csv`, `expenses.csv`) and shows KPIs, monthly P&L, top products, and region/segment performance. Includes Power Query, Data Model (Power Pivot), DAX measures, PivotCharts and a VBA refresh button.

**Files**
- `FinancialDashboard.xlsm` — macro-enabled workbook (enable macros to use the refresh button).
- `sales.csv` — sample sales transactions.
- `expenses.csv` — sample monthly expenses.
- `screenshot.png` — dashboard preview image.

**How to use**
1. Download the repo or the `FinancialDashboard.xlsm` from Releases.
2. Open `FinancialDashboard.xlsm` and enable macros.
3. (Optional) Replace `sales.csv` / `expenses.csv` with your files (keep same column names).
4. Click **Update Dashboard** to refresh data and charts.

**Notes**
- No client data is included — sample / anonymized data only.
- If the workbook is large (>100MB) consider downloading the workbook from Releases.
